## Last Week's Accomplishments

[Plugin is now visible upon Atom startup.](https://github.com/codingandcommunity/fast-forward/pull/3)

[Created a button in the plugin panel that toggles the plugin panel visibility.](https://github.com/codingandcommunity/fast-forward/pull/4)

## This Week's Plan

Implementing code to run `git diff` to discern the code provided to the students from the implementations by students.

The plugin will take the student-implemented code and store that code in another file.
