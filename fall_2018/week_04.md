## This Week's Plan

Continuing to work on scripting the basic processes for the plugin.

## Notes

The hard part is having to dig through the code for atom and other plugins to figure out how to write the code I need to write. There's very little documentation on Atom's file-managment processes and the code itself has very little documentation within it.
