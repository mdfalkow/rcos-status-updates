## Last Week's Accomplishments

    Last week our group broke up into different sub-groups and scheduled meeting times for each team.
    These sub-groups will each focus on one of the following pieces:
        * Backend - developing backend.
        * Plugin - developing the Atom Plugin.
        * Curriculum - developing a curriculum in React.js.
        * Framework Experts - learning a framework so they can be our 'resident expert' in that framework.
        * Website - developing a website for our project.
    My specific role is to work on the Atom Plugin

## This Week's Plan
    
    This weeks plan is for each sub-group to meet and discuss each members' roles and other specific details about development.

## Anything Blocking?

    The Plugin Team has yet to meet to decide individual roles.
