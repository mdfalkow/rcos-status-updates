## Last Week's Accomplishments

Continued to work on basic scripting. Discussed functionality within [Ethan Graf](https://github.com/eagraf) and [Bradford Stone](https://github.com/kazooiebee).

Just found the Atom API documentation! 

## This Week's Plan

Starting to work on implementing the desired functionality for the plugin. 
The API docs should help me move forward easier. 

## Notes

Digging through Atom IDE source code is still fairly difficult.
