## Last Week's Accomplishments

Continued to work on basic scripting. Discussed functionality within [Ethan Graf](https://github.com/eagraf) and [Bradford Stone](https://github.com/kazooiebee).

## This Week's Plan

Going to start working on implementing the desired functionality for the plugin.

## Anything Blocking?

Waiting on someone to push their code to the repository.

## Notes

Digging through Atom IDE source code is still fairly difficult.
