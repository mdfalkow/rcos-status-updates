## Last Week's Accomplishments

Found an Atom IDE package that enables users to execute and run scripts and files in command line.

## This Week's Plan

Figuring out how to use the Atom IDE package to manage a directory (i.e. clear files, push to a remote repository, execute the code, etc.)

## Anything Blocking?

No.
