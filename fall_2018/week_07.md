## Last Week's Accomplishments

I began development of file management using the Node.js file system API. I was able to create a new temporary folder in the user's current active project directory upon clicking a button. I am using node modules to modularize code development. 

## This Week's Plan

Implementing code to copy files from projects into a separate directory. 
Once copying is implemented, I will change the code to copy the changes from the git diff. 
Also researching how to use other packages within Atom, that way I can call the native Git functions in Atom.

## Anything Blocking?

Knowledge of Atom and Node.js.
